Ensure that you have downloaded the entire dataset and place the data files in the correct folder as specified in the project instructions.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to quickly start using the pre-trained `BatteryGPT` model to predict battery status with the provided Python script:

1. Ensure that you have downloaded and properly set up the dataset as described in the [Dataset section](#dataset).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

3. Navigate to the repository directory:

4. Install any necessary dependencies:

5. Run the script to load the pre-trained `BatteryGPT` model and get battery status predictions:
```
$ python sample.py
```
